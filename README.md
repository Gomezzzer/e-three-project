# 3e MVP Specification
3E is a gym scheduling app for its members. This application enable them to check the availability (60 minute time slots) of all employed personal trainers and book a personal training session based off the date selected and personal trainer chosen.

## Pain Point
Other gym scheduling apps prompt members to give a specific time they are available for personal training. This is a lot of guess work. This limits the member's ability to adapt and choose. Therefore, it gives them less power over their own free time.
